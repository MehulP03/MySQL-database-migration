sed is a stream editor for filtering and transforming text. 
In this script, it is used to search for the specified line and comment it out by adding a "--" at the 
beginning of the line.

Make the script executable by running the following command:
chmod +x migration.sh

Then you can execute the script:
./migration.sh
